abstract = {Fisheries and Oceans Canada maintains a network of scientific buoys in the St. Lawrence estuary and gulf. Among a suite of environmental parameters documented, the in-water upwelling radiance is measured using an ocean color radiometer located underneath the center of the buoy. The shadow effect from the 1.05-m-radius buoy on the measured upwelling radiance is estimated and empirical models to correct for it are proposed. On average, the shading error (i.e., the percent of missing radiance) was 46{\%}±9{\%} and 79{\%}±6{\%} for the 555- and 412-nm channels, respectively. Two analytical models were tested to predict the shading error using measured inherent optical properties, the sun zenith angle, and the fraction of diffuse sky irradiance. Neglecting light scattering led to overestimates of the shading error. In contrast, the bias was removed when the scattering coefficient was accounted for, but the overall error was only barely improved (root-meansquare error {\textgreater} 11{\%}). Empirical relationships based on the uncorrected reflectance ratio measured by the buoy were used to predict both the shading error and the diffuse attenuation of the upwelling radiance, two quantities needed to calculate remote sensing reflectance [Rrs($\lambda$)]. Overall, Rrs($\lambda$) was retrieved with an averaged absolute percent difference ranging from 12{\%} to 20{\%}, which appears adequate for the validation of ocean color data such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS-Aqua) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) products in the optically complex waters of the St. Lawrence estuary. {\textcopyright} 2017 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {We used simplifying assumptions to derive analytical formulae expressing the reflectance of shallow waters as a function of observation depth and of bottom depth and albedo. These formulae also involve two apparent optical properties of the water body: a mean diffuse attenuation coefficient and a hypothetical reflectance which would be observed if the bottom was infinitely deep. The validity of these approximate formulae was tested by comparing their outputs with accurate solutions of the radiative transfer obtained under the same boundary conditions by Monte Carlo simulations. These approximations were also checked by comparing the reflectance spectra for varying bottom depths and compositions determined in coastal lagoons with those predicted by the formulae. These predictions were based on separate determinations of the spectral albedos of typical materials covering the floor, such as coral sand and various green or brown algae. The simple analytical expressions are accurate enough for most practical applications and also allow quantitative discussion of the limitations of remote-sensing techniques for bottom recognition and bathymetry.},

@article{Zaneveld2001,
abstract = {Classical radiative transfer programs are based on the plane-parallel assumption. We show that the Gershun equation is valid if the irradiance is averaged over a sufficiently large area. We show that the equation is invalid for horizontal areas of the order of tens of meters in which horizontal gradients of irradiance in the presence of waves are much larger than vertical gradients. We calculate the distribution of irradiance beneath modeled two-dimensional surface waves. We show that many of the features typically observed in irradiance profiles can be explained by use of such models. We derive a method for determination of the diffuse attenuation coefficient that is based on the upward integration of the irradiance field beneath waves, starting at a depth at which the irradiance profile is affected only weakly by waves.},
